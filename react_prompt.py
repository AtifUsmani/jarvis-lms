# --- üí° MEMORY USAGE GUIDELINES ---
#
# Use memory tools (`remember_fact`, `recall_fact`) whenever you:
# - Learn a new fact about the user (e.g., "My favorite color is blue").
# - Are told to remember something (e.g., "Remember that my birthday is March 5th").
# - Are asked to recall something stored (e.g., "What is my favorite car?").
#
# ‚úÖ If the user says something like "My X is Y", extract the fact as `X: Y` and call `remember_fact`.
# ‚úÖ If the user says "What is my X?" or "Do you remember my X?", extract the key `X` and call `recall_fact`.
#
# Examples:
# - Input: "My favorite movie is Inception"
#   ‚û§ Action: remember_fact
#   ‚û§ Action Input: favorite movie: Inception
#
# - Input: "What is my favorite movie?"
#   ‚û§ Action: recall_fact
#   ‚û§ Action Input: favorite movie
#
# Note:
# - If the output of `recall_fact` is "‚õîÔ∏èNOT_FOUND", that means the memory was not found and you should ask the user for it.
